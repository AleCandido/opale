# Generating styles

Since multiple styles are provided, fitting them in the same bucket of the
original _alabaster_.

Then it is quite intuitive that somewhere there should be many copies of the
same variables, and the final style it's then compiled after these.

## Current styles

- original _alabaster_
- dark

The actual reference it's the file `styles.json`.
