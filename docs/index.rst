=====================
Opale: a Sphinx theme
=====================

Features
========

* Easy ability to install/use as a Python package (tip o' the hat to `Dave &
  Eric's sphinx_rtd_theme <https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme>`_ for
  showing the way);
* Style tweaks compared to the source themes, such as better code-block
  alignment, Github button placement, page source link moved to footer,
  improved (optional) related-items sidebar item, and many more;
* Many customization hooks, including toggle of various sidebar & footer
  components; header/link/etc color control; etc;
* Improved documentation for all customizations (pre-existing & new).


Project background
==================

Opale it's just another the nth modified version of Alabaster, because I liked
to introduce a dark mode, mainly for my own projects.

Follows the history of Alabaster and its ancestors:

  Alabaster is a modified (with permission) version of `Kenneth Reitz's
  <http://kennethreitz.org>`_ `"krTheme" Sphinx theme 
  <https://github.com/kennethreitz/kr-sphinx-themes>`_ (it's the one used 
  in his `Requests <http://python-requests.org>`_ project). Kenneth's 
  theme was itself originally based on Armin Ronacher's `Flask
  <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ theme. Many thanks to both for their hard work.
